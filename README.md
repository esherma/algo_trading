# Algorithmic Trading Hack Projects

This repo consists of algorithm implementation and backtesting code for algorithmic trading strategies.

Current replications:
- [Beat the Market An Effective Intraday Momentum Strategy for S&P500 ETF (SPY)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4824172)

Replications are configured to pull data from [Alpaca](alpaca.markets) and use paper trading. With slight modifications, algorithms can be configured to run with real money during live trading.
